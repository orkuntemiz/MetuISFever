.\\tcoronavirus\\tcoronavirus\\tparamyxoviruses\\tparamyxoviruses\\n6\\t\\n7\\t\\n8\\tThe widespread reporting of claims by Kolesnokov and Filatov caused controversy in many Chinese internet discussion boards and chat rooms .\\n9\\tMany Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States , which perceived China 's rise as a potential threat to its dominance and superiority in the world .\\tChina\\tChina\\tbiological weapon\\tbiological weapon\\n10\\t\\n11\\tThe failure to find the source of the SARS virus further convinced these people and many more that SARS was artificially synthesised and spread by some individuals and even governments .\\n12\\tCircumstantial evidence suggests that the SARS virus crossed over to humans from Asian palm civets -LRB- `` civet cats '' -RRB- , a type of animal that is often killed and eaten in Guangdong , where SARS was first discovered .\\tGuangdong\\tGuangdong\\n13\\tHowever , civet cats are extensively used in food production without causing SARS in their handlers .\\n14\\t\\n15\\t\\n16\\tSupporters of the conspiracy theory suggest that SARS caused the most serious harm in mainland China , Hong Kong , Taiwan and Singapore , regions where most Chinese reside , while the United States , Europe and Japan were not affected as much .\\tChina\\tChina\\tHong Kong\\tHong Kong\\tSingapore\\tSingapore\\tEurope\\tEurope\\tJapan\\tJapan\\n17\\tHowever , the highest mortality from SARS outside of China occurred in Canada where 43 died .\\tChina\\tChina\\n18\\tConspiracists further point out that SARS has an average mortality rate of around 10 % around the world , but no one died in the United States from SARS , despite the fact that there were 8 confirmed cases out of 27 probable cases -LRB- 10 % of 8 people is less than 1 person -RRB- .\\n19\\tRegarding reasons why SARS patients in the United States experienced a relatively mild illness , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has explained that anybody with fever and a respiratory symptom who had traveled to an affected area was included as a SARS patient in the U.S. , even though many of these were found to have had other respiratory illnesses .\\tCenters for Disease Control\\tCenters for Disease Control\\n20\\t\\n21\\t\\n22\\tIn October 2003 , Tong Zeng , a Chinese lawyer and a volunteer in a 1998 Chinese-American medical cooperation program , published a book that again speculated that SARS could be a biological weapon developed by the United States against China .\\tChina\\tChina\\tbiological weapon\\tbiological weapon\\n23\\tIn the book , Tong disclosed that in the 1990s , many American research groups collected thousands of blood and DNA samples and specimens of mainland Chinese -LRB- including 5,000 DNA samples from twins -RRB- through numerous joint research projects carried out in China .\\tChina\\tChina\\tblood\\tblood\\tDNA\\tDNA\\n24\\tThese samples were then sent back to the United States for further research , and could be used in developing biological weapons targeting Chinese .\\n25\\tThese samples came from 22 provinces in China , all of which were hit by SARS in 2003 .\\tChina\\tChina\\n26\\tOnly provinces like Yunnan , Guizhou , Hainan , Tibet , and Xinjiang were left out , and all these provinces suffered less severely during the SARS outbreak .\\tYunnan\\tYunnan\\tGuizhou\\tGuizhou\\tHainan\\tHainan\\tTibet\\tTibet\\tXinjiang\\tXinjiang\\n27\\tThe author suspects that Japan is also involved , as many Japanese factories in Guangdong in the 1990s made it compulsory for all workers to have blood tests in the factory annually , rather than asking workers to go to local hospitals for blood tests and a proper physical examination .\\tGuangdong\\tGuangdong\\tJapan\\tJapan\\tblood\\tblood\\n28\\tHowever , Tong Zeng admits that these are only speculations , and he does not have any concrete proof from the study of the virus 's

world and thus the SARS virus must have been produced under laboratory conditions .\\n2\\tAnother Russian scientist , Nikolai Filatov , head of Moscow 's epidemiological services , had earlier commented that the SARS virus was probably man-made .\\tNikolai Filatov\\tNikolai Filatov\\tMoscow\\tMoscow\\tepidemiological\\tepidemiology\\n3\\t\\n4\\tHowever , independent labs concluded these claims to be premature since the SARS virus is a coronavirus , whereas measles and mumps are paramyxoviruses .\\tmeasles\\tmeasles\\tmumps\\tmumps\\tcoronavirus\\tcoronavirus\\tparamyxoviruses\\tparamyxoviruses\\n5\\tThe primary differences between a coronavirus and a parmyxovirus are in their structures and method of infection , thus making it implausible for a coronavirus was created from two paramyxoviruses .\\tcoronavirus\\tcoronavirus\\tparamyxoviruses\\tparamyxoviruses\\n6\\t\\n7\\t\\n8\\tThe widespread reporting of claims by Kolesnokov and Filatov caused controversy in many Chinese internet discussion boards and chat rooms .\\n9\\tMany Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States , which perceived China 's rise as a potential threat to its dominance and superiority in the world .\\tChina\\tChina\\tbiological

individuals and even governments .\\n12\\tCircumstantial evidence suggests that the SARS virus crossed over to humans from Asian palm civets -LRB- `` civet cats '' -RRB- , a type of animal that is often killed and eaten in Guangdong , where SARS was first discovered .\\tGuangdong\\tGuangdong\\n13\\tHowever , civet cats are extensively used in food production without causing SARS in their handlers .\\n14\\t\\n15\\t\\n16\\tSupporters of the conspiracy theory suggest that SARS caused the most serious harm in mainland China , Hong Kong , Taiwan and Singapore , regions where most Chinese reside , while the United States , Europe and Japan were not affected as much .\\tChina\\tChina\\tHong Kong\\tHong Kong\\tSingapore\\tSingapore\\tEurope\\tEurope\\tJapan\\tJapan\\n17\\tHowever , the highest mortality from SARS outside of China occurred in Canada where 43 died .\\tChina\\tChina\\n18\\tConspiracists further point out that SARS has an average mortality rate of around 10 % around the world , but no one died in the United States from SARS , despite the fact that there were 8 confirmed cases out of 27 probable cases -LRB- 10 % of 8 people is less than 1 person -RRB- .\\n19\\tRegarding reasons why SARS patients in the United States experienced a relatively mild illness , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has explained that anybody with fever and a respiratory symptom who had traveled to an affected area was included as a SARS patient in the U.S. , even though many of these were found to have had other respiratory illnesses .\\tCenters for Disease Control\\tCenters for Disease Control\\n20\\t\\n21\\t\\n22\\tIn October 2003 , Tong Zeng , a Chinese lawyer and a volunteer in a 1998 Chinese-American medical cooperation program , published a book that again speculated that SARS could be a biological weapon developed by the United States against China .\\tChina\\tChina\\tbiological weapon\\tbiological weapon\\n23\\tIn the book , Tong disclosed that in the 1990s , many American research groups collected thousands of blood and DNA samples and specimens of mainland Chinese -LRB- including 5,000 DNA samples from twins -RRB- through numerous joint research projects carried out in China .\\tChina\\tChina\\tblood\\tblood\\tDNA\\tDNA\\n24\\tThese samples were then sent back to the United States for further research , and could be used in developing biological weapons targeting Chinese .\\n25\\tThese samples came from 22 provinces in China , all of which were hit by SARS in 2003 .\\tChina\\tChina\\n26\\tOnly provinces like Yunnan ,

.\\tGuangdong\\tGuangdong\\tJapan\\tJapan\\tblood\\tblood\\n28\\tHowever , Tong Zeng admits that these are only speculations , and he does not have any concrete proof from the study of the virus 's
